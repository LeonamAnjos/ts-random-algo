/*
Conwayâ€™s Game of Life
The game is played on a grid of cells.
Each cell can be populated or unpopulated.

The game takes place over a series of generations. Each generation is derived from the previous generation by applying a set of rules as follows:

For a cell that is populated:
If it has one or less populated neighbours, it dies
If it has four or more populated neighbours, it dies
If it has  two or three populated neighbours, it survives

For a cell that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'
If it has three neighbours, it becomes populated.

NB: All rules are applied in parallel. That is, the death of a cell in this generation does not affect its neighbours in this generation
